- `App.jsx`: Main file where the accordion is implemented.
- `index.css`: Contains additional custom styles.
- `main.jsx`: Entry point for the React application.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. The `AccordionItem` component manages its own open/close state using React hooks.
2. Tailwind CSS classes handle the styling, providing a clean and responsive design.
3. Icons from `react-icons` are used to indicate the state of each accordion item.
